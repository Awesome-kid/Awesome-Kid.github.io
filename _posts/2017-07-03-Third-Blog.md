# **Blog Trois**

### Today,was the most I have Improved,within the last three lessons ,as I have amazingly gone from 9% to 19%(was that not a decent improvement).Anyway,in today's lesson I learnt about "string".The thing about string is that it always in words.It was quite hard for me as , in the exercise ,we had to work with different variables.The fact that you needed to do something else from what it finally should be.

### The next section was section 3, In section 3 I had to use a lot of percentages,this section had 6 exercises,only the first three were easy.Because,afterwards I needed to use a lot of my brain to work out that time and date (because that's what our task).Also,the last exercise was so hard , as,it had asked us to put the codes together which for me was difficult ,I didn't understand at first until, We got help from our teachers.

That's all for today amigos 

Keep on Coding
