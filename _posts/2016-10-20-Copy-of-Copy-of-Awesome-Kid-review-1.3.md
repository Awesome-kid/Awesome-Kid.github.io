    <td>Now I need to get faster at making files and putting it in the appropriate place.Also, sometimes I am quite silly and make it as a document so I won't be able to save anything on it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will bring in a memory stick so I can save all my files,so that I can get things done quicker.I will improve my learning by helping my partner so he can get things done and he will also try to help me.</td>
