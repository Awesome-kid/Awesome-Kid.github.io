    <td>We still struggle with setting up as we needed to put all the wires in.However, we were much quicker than before.Also we struggled to save things as we used another computer which means other people would have their data on it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For, next time I will need to be quicker on setting things up, and try to make my own file at the beginning so I can just save all the work in it straight away.Also, I will try to share the code typing with my partner more.</td>
