Blog three

Today we learnt how to change the   background of this website ( blue and green). To do this i went onto a website called HTML colour picker where i chose a colour for my background and headings.After that, i went onto my style scss file where i changed my colours.During the lesson i think i could have been faster by using the ctrl x and ctrl v to copy and paste. The colours i chose were blue and green.

That is all i have done so far 

From Awesome kid.
