## **The Blog 2.0**

#### My second lesson,was a blast I went through many of the exercises and I got to about 9%which means I am improving. I am almost finished on the Second area with only 2 more exercises to go(lucky me!).You guys know how I told you that you need to know maths, during the. lesson I ,learned about the different symbols used for addition,takeaway, multiplication and Division.

Division \

Multiplication *

Subtraction -

Addition +

During the lesson I made a foolish mistake because,the question tells me to make the code from marty(or something?)not python.And for 5 min I was trying to work out the question.Until both teachers shouted and screamed " Marty(or something?)not python you stupid child â€œ.Which is when I realised and got the answer correct(That's when AwesomeKid realised that he is dumb(only JK)).

That's all from today's blog !

Keep on Coding!
