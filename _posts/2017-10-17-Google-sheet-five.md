In Today's lesson we learned that in your company you will have people who will work for you.Each of them has a specific job , showing how much they get paid.To find out how much they earn before tax I got how much they earn times by the amount of hours,the code might have looked something like this,=product(E9:F9).

In the Vat section I got the amount of the Subtotal which is before Tax,and then multiplied it by 0.2 as it gave me 20% of the subtotal which is the tax that is taken off.Therefore, to calculate the grand total all I had to do was to subtract the tax from the subtotal giving the amount.
