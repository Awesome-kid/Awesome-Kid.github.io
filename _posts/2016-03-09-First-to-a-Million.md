First to a million

Today we watched a series of videos called first to a million ,it had an interesting story line, which started when two mates met up and had lots of fun together and watched video.After watching the video  they realised how many views it had and thought they could do something like that, suddenly one of two mates had an elder brother with his gang , they challenged the two to a competition,first to a million is better and is  proved to be better than the other.During the videos you had to choose decisions which were fun and tricky.However, both teams got a bit out of hand and many disasters struck. The main reason why we actually watched was to not enjoy but to also learn at the same time, during this we learnt how to choose the right decisions and how to prevent things going to a bad case.

The people made it were called CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection).They made it,to show how simple things can get out of hands and cause trouble, not only that they showed what a[other websites can help like Ceop,Childline and Teenage Mentors.On the website Ceop , there is a page called " Think u know" on this page there is an age selection to choose and every one of them gives you advice and videos .

That's all from Awesome Kid
