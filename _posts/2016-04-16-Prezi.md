Prezi

Today we looked at Prezi because our homework was to create a presentation on 'The History of Computers'.When our teacher checked if we had handed it in properly , many failed to do so, just by clicking the share button( but i wasn't one of them) .After a disappointing start our teacher choose someone presentation told us what  he could improve,we could improve.

During the next part of the lesson, our teacher showed us a terrible presentation made by another kid, which if you could see right now you would realise all of it was plagiarized and most of it was fake. We can surely see that the person took no care of the work and made silly , careless mistakes such as :

. Spelling mistake

.Punctuation

.Grammer

.Capital letters

Here are also more mistakes that you could avoid in the future:

.Chronological order

.Not too big handwriting

. Use a maximum of 3 colours plus  black and white

That's all from Awesome-Kid.
