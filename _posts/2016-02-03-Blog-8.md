Blog 8

Today in our lesson we were looking at the goods and bads things about social media for example a good thing could be to talk from different countries and, a bad thing could be getting hacked and losing all your private account whereas a good thing would be to talk long range .After making a chart on the goods and bads we were all put in groups of 6 ,we were given a series of problems and scenarios and put them in the right order. At the end would  be a comment saying " I am going on holiday and the house is free". This is very stupid thing as it could attract a lot of burglars.This means posting stuff could get you into trouble.

That's all

Awesome Kid
