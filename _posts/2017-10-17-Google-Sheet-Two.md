In today's lesson I had made my order form,with the :Item,Quantity,Cost Price and Total Price.

The main code in today's lesson is the V-lookup a it helped me fill in the gaps in the table easier.In the Item section I used , =VLOOKUP(B3,Stock holding,2,false),this helped me find the item relating to the code.This is why the code from last weeks blog was important as it helped us identify which code was for which item. Also, another  thing I used the V-lookup was for the cost price, in here i put in,

=VLOOKUP(B3,Stockholding,5,false)the reason why theese are the same is becuase the code shows the item ,quantity and cost price.

This in a way concludes us as we know that V-lookup helps us to find what we need as long as it is linked to a certain number/letter it can find anything even if its on another sheet,but on the same document.
