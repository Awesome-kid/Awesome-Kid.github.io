  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that people can easily copy your code and sell them to other people f they are not unique and different.The more longer the more complex and harder it will be for the person to copy the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Luckily for this lesson the work wasn't as hard as it was last lesson,therefore i did not have to use my note section in the diary to help me.Maybe If had looked into the borders quickly I would have known that you can add some on the sides,or bottom,or top.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time will try to take notes on all important parts during the lesson,Maybe,I should ask the teacher If I  am stuck with something and then I can get things done faster instead of asking my friends who are also stuck as well as me.</td>
