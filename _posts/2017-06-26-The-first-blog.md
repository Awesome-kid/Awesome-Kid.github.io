# **Blog Uno**

#### Today was my first day into Python coding.My objective was to get more than 5 % so I can keep up the pace to reach to a 100.During the lesson I learnt more about Boolean and how you need to use true and false.Also,I made a code with my own variable and make numbers for it.At the end of the lesson I had reached my target and I was actually quite proud of myself,why you ask,because I managed to get the 5% I needed this shows me that I can do well and I can get through this quickly.

#### Another cool thing was that,during the coding there was strangely a lot of Math.You heard me right ! I said math.Another,fun thing was that at the end there was a quiz ,where I did quite well in,and I got a good score.

#### That's all from today's blog

#### Keep on Coding !
