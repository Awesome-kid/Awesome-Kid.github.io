Blog 4

  

Today in our lesson we were discussing with our teacher about peeedofiles, who are adults 

which sexually love children . Our teacher was telling us about how to be safe online not having peedofiles following us. Another thing our teacher was telling was the fact that some people post very rude things , but not meaning to in such a harsh way, some people have done this immature work and have been sacked/resigned.E.g a Pcc youth had to resign due to having a racist twitter row.From this lesson i have learnt that posting silly irresponsible thing which rude in being racist or stereotypical could you into a lot of trouble.

Be safe
