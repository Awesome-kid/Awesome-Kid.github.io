Micro Bit

### 	Today in our lesson we looked at a micro bit and thought what it could do . Our teacher showed us a video on what people would with a micro bit. At first I thought would be impossible for me to make. After looking at the video our teacher let us make some code for the micro bit , which at first seemed quite easy and then I realised that making a code wasn't as hard as i thought it would be.

### At the end of the lesson I created three fun modes to go on like the mood swing, dice roll and the bully machine. That's also when I realised to make a teleporter or a electric glove could actually possible.

### That's all from Awesome-Kid.
