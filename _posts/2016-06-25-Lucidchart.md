Lucidchart

Today we were assigned to make our very own game on microbit.At first I thought this was impossible , like i thought before.During our lesson our showed us a flow chart and what it does.Then our teacher told us to make our own flowchart to make for our game.

Later on the lesson we got in groups of 3 and 2 . I was with Archit and Will H because we had similar ideas to each other.
