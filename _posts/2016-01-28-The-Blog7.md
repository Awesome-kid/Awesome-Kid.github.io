**Blog 7**

Today during our lesson we were taking part the advert and focusing on the fantasy part. Our teacher showed us a Pepsi Max video.We mainly focused on the fantasy , such as the taxi being driven by a monkey or some how the cars manage to not crash into each other.

Furthermore, we looked into the advert more deeper and how the fantasy relates to what it is trying to tell us. In this case it's telling us Pepsi Max gives a really good boost even though it contains no sugar. 

That is all

Awesome kid.
