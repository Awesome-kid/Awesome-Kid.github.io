During Today's lesson I knew that Google Sheets are used almost everywhere and everyday, this is because of how easy they are to use and how they can store all your important data ( as in numbers of certain objects ).

In my first lesson we started to make our own business and for that we made a stock sheet, this shows what we had and how much they cost.For each and every item there is a code like A1,this code symbolises and represents the object.The other three titles i had were Quantity,Cost Price and Total Price,to find out the total price I had to put in a certain code which started with , =product(D7:E7),this as it says in the code,gives me the product of the two numbers in the boxes D7 and E7. In D7 there will be Quantity and in E7 there will be Cost Price therefore, the product of these gives me the total price.
