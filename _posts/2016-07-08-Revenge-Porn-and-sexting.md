**Revenge Porn and Sexting**

Today we learnt how people feel when they're the victim of revenge Porn and Sexting. Mainly Teenage girls have a few reasons for why they participate in sexting: 40 percent do it as a joke, 34 percent do it to feel good, and 12 percent feel pressured to do it.These statistics are very bad because most of them do it as a joke, but what they donâ€™t realise is that how it could all go terribly wrong.15% of teens who have sent or posted nude/semi-nude images of themselves send these messages to people they have never met, but know from the Internet. This makes things worse as these victims can fall into grooming,blackmail and cyber bullying. 

However , Revenge Porn is much much more worser, victims have a much more higher chance of grooming, blackmail and cyber bullying. As we know Revenge porn can be spread around the internet , and can also be put on porn sites and on auctions. Furthermore, Revenge Porn is also used for blackmailing the victim, by making them do dangerous things such as stealing or murder.

That's all from Awesome-Kid
