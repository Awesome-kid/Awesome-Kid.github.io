Presentations

Today we learnt the true definition of a presentation and how to perform the best , using powerful techniques. Most of our lesson we looked at Prezi 

A programme used to make presentations, on prezi we were allowed to explore and look at all the different things available.On my presentation i did photos of star wars characters ( big Star wars fan),looking back at it Prezi seems to be a very useful tool when making presentations.However to actually use it you need to have an Adobe flash higher than 11.Even though Prezi is great  to actually create a true presentation, the presenter also needs to up on high standards( not too boring and not too fun).

That's all from AwesomeKid.
