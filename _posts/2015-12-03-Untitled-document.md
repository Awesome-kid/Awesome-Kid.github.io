Blog 2

 

Today we learnt how to make this website (which you are currently on).To make  this website we went onto Github were go onto jekyll , which therefore, allows us to use Gabriel which i use to post my blogs on. During the lesson i think i could have been a bit faster and not made silly ,stupid mistakes. 

That is all i have done so far, for more blogs come to this website every week.
