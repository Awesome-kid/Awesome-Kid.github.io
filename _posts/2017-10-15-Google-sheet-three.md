    <td>I learnt that you have to make different codes to have a certain discount to them.I also learnt to use the sum tool in my code as it helped me add up everything and put it into my grand total.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I should learn to take notes as it would save me from asking my friends around me for help , when I should know what i need to be doing.This limited my learning as I was slower and wasn't able to get as far as I could in the lesson therefore I had to do it for homework.</td>
