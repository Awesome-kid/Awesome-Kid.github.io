Navigator Media

Today at we all shared our identity map which we were told to make on the last day of term, however doing this brings up many questions.

**_MY Identity map_**

To start off with , that actually making an identity map is quite tricking because you have to have the right amount of data ( not to much and not too little). Commenting on the maps of other people were actually quite difficult because some people did theirs really bad and so when i commented i wrote something to improve in bad way .In addition, the way we did this was definitely different to online because we actually knew it's one of your mates , whereas  online you could chuck anything at the person rude or not. The activity we did ,changed my perspective of social media a lot because, now I know not to post to much and add some colour to my work , but if i had to change something on social media is maybe when you can change something after you post it so then people donâ€™t take it the wrong way.The past 6 lessons changed my future on my social media because now i understand how dangerous and how good social media is , and gives me a brief idea on how to post something.

That's all from Awesomekid
